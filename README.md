- 👋 Hi, I’m @jakobpotosme. I am a new graduate with a Bachelor's of Computer Science and Engineering degree from University of California, Merced. 

- 👀 I’m interested in creating excellent user experiences allowing users to interact with modern full stack technologies. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning technologies related to the Web3 ecosystem by contributing and creating projects that are beneficial to the community.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on either Web2 or Web3 projects that want to tackle a major problem.
